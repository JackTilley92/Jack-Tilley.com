If the element\r\n *    that we want to apply before and after elements is a HTML tag (i.e. a\r\n *    div, p, or button tag), we can avoid this extra nesting by passing using\r\n *    the BeforeAfterWrapper in place of said tag like so:\r\n *\r\n *  <p>\r\n *    <BeforeAfterWrapper>   do this instead   <BeforeAfterWrapper elementType='p'>\r\n *      [children of p]          ------>         [children of p]\r\n *    </BeforeAfterWrapper>                    </BeforeAfterWrapper>\r\n *  </p>\r\n *\r\n *  BeforeAfterWrapper features spread functionality. This means that we can\r\n *  pass HTML tag properties directly into the BeforeAfterWrapper tag.\r\n *\r\n *  When using BeforeAfterWrapper, ensure that the parent of the beforeElement\r\n *  and afterElement have a defined style position.\r\n */\r\n\r\nvar styles = {\r\n  box: {\r\n    boxSizing: 'border-box'\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n\r\nvar BeforeAfterWrapper = function (_Component) {\r\n  (0, _inherits3.default)(BeforeAfterWrapper, _Component);\r\n\r\n  function BeforeAfterWrapper() {\r\n    (0, _classCallCheck3.default)(this, BeforeAfterWrapper);\r\n    return (0, _possibleConstructorReturn3.default)(this, (BeforeAfterWrapper.__proto__ || (0, _getPrototypeOf2.default)(BeforeAfterWrapper)).apply(this, arguments));\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  (0, _createClass3.default)(BeforeAfterWrapper, [{\r\n    key: 'render',\r\n    value: function render() {\r\n      var _props = this.props,\r\n          beforeStyle = _props.beforeStyle,\r\n          afterStyle = _props.afterStyle,\r\n          beforeElementType = _props.beforeElementType,\r\n          afterElementType = _props.afterElementType,\r\n          elementType = _props.elementType,\r\n          other = (0, _objectWithoutProperties3.default)(_props, ['beforeStyle', 'afterStyle', 'beforeElementType', 'afterElementType', 'elementType']);\r\n      var prepareStyles = this.context.muiTheme.prepareStyles;\r\n\r\n\r\n      var beforeElement = void 0;\r\n      var afterElement = void 0;\r\n\r\n      if (beforeStyle) {\r\n        beforeElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.beforeElementType, {\r\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, beforeStyle)),\r\n          key: '::before'\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      if (afterStyle) {\r\n        afterElement = _react2.default.createElement(this.props.afterElementType, {\r\n          style: prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, styles.box, afterStyle)),\r\n          key: '::after'\r\n        });\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      var children = [beforeElement, this.props.children, afterElement];\r\n\r\n      var props = other;\r\n      props.style = prepareStyles((0, _simpleAssign2.default)({}, this.props.style));\r\n\r\n      return _react2.default.createElement(this.props.elementType, props, children);\r\n    }\r\n  }]);\r\n  return BeforeAfterWrapper;\r\n}(_react.Component);\r\n\r\nBeforeAfterWrapper.defaultProps = {\r\n  beforeElementType: 'div',\r\n  afterElementType: 'div',\r\n  elementType: 'div'\r\n};\r\nBeforeAfterWrapper.contextTypes = {\r\n  muiTheme: _react.PropTypes.object.isRequired\r\n};\r\nprocess.env.NODE_ENV !== \"production\" ?
